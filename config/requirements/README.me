- `base.txt` was compiled for python-3.12
- `server.txt` was then compiled based on `base.txt`

- `base_py3-8.txt` was compiled for python-3.8 as an installation experiment
- `server_py3-8.in` refers to `base_py3-8.txt`
- `server_py3-8.in.txt` was then compiled based on `server_py3-8.in`

- a python-3.8 venv was then successfully populated from `server_py3-8.in.txt`, but the code didn't work because all the type-hints are for python-3.12
